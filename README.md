# jbook app üóíÔ∏è

## WIP
This is pretty much a work in progress and has a couple missing features.
I started doing this under guidance as a way to learn/improve typescript


## Built with
- Typescript
- React
- Redux
- esbuild-wasm
- react-md-editor
- react-resizable
- bulmaswatch for styles

## TODO:
- Data Persistence;
- Fix the bug causing the rendered code inside the iframe disappear when moving the window down;
- Feature to save the text/code into a md/json file (exporting);
- Themes;
- Fix syntax highlighting; 
- A couple more features that I can't realize right now.
